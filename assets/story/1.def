;Reimu: WHAT?!
; *Reimu looks around*
;Reimu: WHERE ARE MY DANGO?!

;Marisa comes in
;Marisa: Reeeeimu, I've come to play, daze.
;Reimu: You! You took them, didn't you?
;Marisa: What did I take, daze? Was I supposed to take something, daze?
;Reimu: I'll make you confess!


; Marisa lying on the floor
; Marisa: Ouch ouch ouch, what was that for, daze?
; Marisa: I didn't take anything, daze.
; Reimu: I see. Then this can only mean one thing.
; Reimu goes back a few steps and turns around dramatically
; Reimu: THIS IS AN INCIDENT!
; Marisa: Daze?
; Reimu: LET'S INVESTIGATE!
; Reimu runs off to the right Marisa looks after her
; Marisa looking around confused
; Marisa runs off to the right

; Forest of Magic, Alice's house or Graveyard
; Reimu: Look Marisa, it's our friend! Youmu Konpaku! Look, she even has her sword and everything.
; Reimu: Maybe she, Youmu Konpaku, our valued friend, has seen my dango!
; Marisa: Daze.
; Reimu: Youmu Konpaku 
; Youmu: You guys...
; Youmu: What the hell are you idiots doing?
; Marisa: Daze?
; Youmu: I know you're sad Guilty Gear 2 flopped. I know you're sad we were forgotten and ended up in Gensokyo.
; Reimu: My dango...
; Youmu: But running around, clinging to the past like that. Can't you see how damaging this is? You need to let go and accept.
; Reimu: So you haven't seen my dango?
; Youmu: SOL! GET A GRIP!
; Reimu: I get it.
; Reimi: You were the one who took them!
; Marisa: DAZE!
; Runs in front
; Reimu: Marisa? You want to fight for my sake?
; Youmu: YOU'RE BOTH MORONS!


; Youmu: Can't believe I lost to an idiot roleplaying as a little girl.
; Marisa: Daze.
; Reimu starts walking right
; Youmu: And stop saying Daze all the darn time!
; Marisa: Dattebayo
; Youmu: Now you want to be Naruto?!
; Marisa: Yes, dattebayo.

; Clock tower, daytime
; Youmu: - understand, it would be faster to just get new dango!
; Sol: This is an incident and solving incidents is the shrine maiden's job.
; Youmu: YOU'RE NOT A SHRINE MAIDEN! HECK YOU'RE NOT EVEN A MAIDEN!
; Youmu: Where is the real o-
; Reimu: THIS SMELL!
; Reimu: It smells of Dango!
; Marisa: Reimu is poor, so her sense of smell is really advanced, dattebayo. I read that in a doujin, dattebayo.
; Shinmyoumaru: If you're looking for dango, I might be able to help you, Reiku!
; Shinmyoumaru: Then again, Gensukyu won't be around for much longer anyway.
; Reimu: Hey, it's Shinmyoumi- Shimyouma- Shimmi- Hey, it's the inchling!
; Youmu: CHIPP, WHAT THE HELL?! YOU'RE TINY!
; Shinmyoumaru: I'm an unchling.
; Marisa: Shin like the knee part. Myou like Myon, Youmu's ghost half. Maru like Shinmyoumaru.
; Marisa: Easy to remember, dattebayo.
; Youmu: No, you're not an inchling, you're an ex-drug-addict ninja!
; Shinmyoumaru: Don't take drugs, kids. They'll mess with your body, years after you're clean.
; Youmu: I've had it with your nonsense!

; Shinmyoumaru: Save me, Seydscha!
; Reimu: Dying aside, why are you smelling like dango, Kneemyonmaru?
; Shinmyoumaru: At the shri-
; Reimu zooms past her
; Youmu: What did you mean by "Gensokyo won't be around for much longer"?
; Shinmyoumaru: Someone is trying to usurp a Gensukyu and destroy a barrier.
; Shinmyoumaru: "Restore the forgotten to the real world!"
; Shinmyoumaru: Sorry. I don't know that much about Touhou, I only listen to the music.
; Marisa: I have a bad feeling about this, dattebayo.

; Hakurei shrine - night
; Reimu: Where's the big bad? Who took my dango?
; Youmu: And why do they want to destroy the barrier between Gensokyo and the real world?
; Reimu: Dango...
; Marisa: Destroying the barrier means all the things forgotten by history will return to the real world, rightze?
; Reimu: ...
; Youmu: Sol? 
; Reimu: ... It's garbage.
; Reimu: Street Fighter this, Mortal Kombat that, while we're wasting away in this place.
; Shinmyoumaru: Sol? I thought that was Reiku?
; Reimu: All we ever get are XX remakes. Give me an X3, dammit!
; Shinmyoumaru: Then who am I? I want to be Ibuki from Street Fighter.
; Marisa: Sol...
; Marisa: Now that we are done pretending to be little girls, where is my son?
; Sol: Let's destroy the barrier and bring the fight to the real world!
; Reimu starts walking behind Sol
; Sol: We can be more than cult classics! I want to break free!
; Everyone starts shaking
; Marisa: S- Sol.
; Reimu: So you're the one running around causing trouble.
; Sol jumps away
; Shinmyoumaru: IT'S THE CRIMSON SLASHER!
; Reimu: Found you! Prepare to be exterminated!
; Sol: I'll break the barrier and nobody will stop me!
; Reimu: I'll stop you and eat those dango I found!
; Sol: WHAT?!

; Reimu lying on the floor
; Sol: Hell yeah, I won!
; Reimu getting up
; Reimu: Okay, I want a rematch.
; Sol: No, I won, it's over.
; Reimu: You don't know how this works, do you? We fight until I win.
; Sol: This is dumb! I'm going to destroy the barrier now!
; Everyone except Benkei starts glowing, Chipp is regular Chipp again
; Marisa: What's going on?!
; Chipp: We're being sucked out of Gensukyu!
; Chipp: Apparently a new Guilty Gear got released and its amazing!
; Chipp: We're back baby! People remember us!
; Youmu: I don't think that's how this Gensokyo thing works. You don't just glow and get whisked away.
; Sol: Xrd, here we come. Let's rock!
; Screen fades to black as their xscale turns to 0


; Guilty Gear Xrd - Sign went on to (almost) become the most successful Guilty Gear game in the franchise.
; Guilty Gear X for the Dreamcast is still number 1 baby.
; Cut back to Baiken
; Youmu: HOW MUCH LONGER WILL I BE STUCK HERE?! 
; Reimu comes in from the left
; Reimu: Until Rev2.
; Reimu: Now get back to sweeping.
; THE END

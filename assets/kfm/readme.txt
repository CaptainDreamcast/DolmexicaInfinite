Controls

Basic Controls
--------------

Kung Fu Man is a 4-button character. Button X is his weak
punch, button Y his strong punch, A for weak kick, and
B for his strong kick. We will use W. to mean weak, and S.
for strong.

We will use the notation:
D - down
F - forward
U - up
B - back
x - button X (weak punch)
y - button Y (strong punch)
a - button A (weak kick)
b - button B (strong kick)

DF means diagonally down-forwards, UB diagonally up-back,
etc. If you see ab it means press button A and button B
simultaneously. x/y means hit either x or y, and so on.

Use the direction keys to move KFM. Press down to crouch,
and up to jump. While in the air, you can press up again to
air-jump. Hold the direction facing away from the opponent
to guard. KFM can guard attacks while jumping.

When falling in the air, hit buttons X and Y at the same
time to recover. Hold a directional key when recovering to
move a little bit in that direction. If you are near the
ground when you hit xy, you will do a ground-based recovery
instead.

KFM has a taunt. To do it, press the start button.

Combo notes
===========

KFM's strengths lie in his ability to chain moves into each
other. Here are his basic combo rules:

1.  You can combo from weaker basic attacks into stronger ones
    eg. light kick -> strong kick

2.  You can combo into special attacks from most basic attacks
    eg. stand strong punch -> Kung Fu Palm

3.  You can combo into hyper attacks from all basic and special
    attacks
    eg. Kung Fu Palm -> Triple Kung Fu Palm

4.  You can combo from hyper attacks into other hyper attacks,
    as long as you do not do the same hyper twice in a row
    eg. Triple Kung Fu Palm -> Smash Kung Fu Upper

These rules make it possible for you to do some damaging combos.
